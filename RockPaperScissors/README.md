# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## What is this?

This is a basic rendition of the game. 

## How does it work?

Each button has an event listener that passes in a specified input into a playGame() function. That function generates a random input for the computer, basically uses a switch statement to see who won, and uses the HTML DOM to output those results to the user. 

## What did I learn from it? 

This was one of the first JavaScript projects, so it was basically a review of everything I already knew. There was basic HTML DOM involved, functions and their return types, and random number generation and its applications.
