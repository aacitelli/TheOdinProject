# Etch A Sketch

## What is this?

This is a grid that you can draw on. It's similar to an Etch A Sketch, but has a lot of different things, too. You can check it out on my website. 

## How does it work?

All the work for this is done up front. The program goes through the following general steps:

1. Construct all the normal front-end stuff including the canvas that all the little squares are rendered in
2. Go through a JS loop that makes ~200 squares inside the canvas
3. Assign an event listener to each one of them that makes them light up a different, random color on hover

There is also a reset button which basically loops through each box and sets its color back to white.

## What did I learn from it?

I learned a lot about the HTML DOM and how to interact with it. I also learned a lot about event listeners, the events that can trigger them, and things that you can do with them.
