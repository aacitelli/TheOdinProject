# Odin On Rails

## What is this? 

This is just the introductory project; The goal is just to set up a ruby on rails project and run it on a local server to make sure you have all the tools you'll need set up. 

## What did I learn from it? 

I got a good overview of many of the different technologies in web development and got a refresher on what they all did. Again, this was a very quick thing, though, so I didn't spend much time on it. It's just to make sure everything got installed correctly.
