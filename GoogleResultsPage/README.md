# Google Results Page

This is a remake of the basic google results page, meaning it's a little more complicated than the homepage. 

It's worth nothing with this that I was mostly focused on making the layout work; This means I didn't really care about precision, because it wasn't important to me and I don't learn much from just modifying margins or padding slightly or trying to perfectly imitate the webpage. It wouldn't take long to do those things, but I don't really learn anything from them. 

## What did I learn from it? 

This was basically a review of basic HTML/CSS and how layout works. I already knew most of it, but it was good review and concreted how a few CSS properties work.
